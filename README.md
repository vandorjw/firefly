## Netlify with Google Firebase

Web Projects from 10 years ago didn't need to be bundled and minified. All I needed to do was write some `html`, style it with some `css`, and add some `JavaScript`.

:sparkles: __This project uses VueJS without needing a build environment.__ :star2:

Instead of downloading 200+ Mb of node packages :poop: before I can write a single line of code, I have included only the packages I needed via `<script>` tags on `index.html`. :thumbsup:

I used the code found in https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth for authentication and wrapped it up in a Vue Component. 


## Tools used
